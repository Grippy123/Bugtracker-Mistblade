Description: 

Looking for some help.
I refunded my pvp conquest shoulders within the refund time frame and hopped into a BG que. 
After entering, my shoulders disappeared, but was not been refunded any of my conquest points. 
The shoulders have officially disappeared along with the points. 
I worked hard to get them this morning, but now I am out and behind 1750 conquest points. Any help would be appreciated. 

Current behaviour: Refunding my cinquest shoulders when entering a BG will NOT refund my conquesat points. 

Expected behaviour: Conquest Points should be refunded. 

Steps to Reproduce: 
1. Buy Conquest shoulders. 
2. Use Conquest shoulders in arena or any instance.
3. Que for BG.
4. When BG que pops, sell your conquest shoulders, and then enter BG.
5. Item should have disappeared, but does not refund any conquest points.
